A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects.<br/>
a.Make sure whether Nodejs is installed or not <br/>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To check it first navigate to command line and type node -v <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the output shows node is not recognised as internal or external command than we can conclude node is not installed locally<br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To install nodejs use these [link](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download only the recommanded for most users

b.Make sure whether Ionic is installed or not <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To check it first navigate to command line <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;and start typing the command as ionic -v <br/>

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;if the output shows ionic is not recognised as internal or external command than we can conclude ionic is not installed locally<br/>

To install ionic locally use the below commands

if you are using a MAC OS or Ubuntu please use these command to install the ionic CLI if it is not installed locally

```bash
$ sudo npm install -g ionic cordova
```
if you are using windows use these command to install the ionic CLI if it is not installed locally<br/>
```bash
$ npm install -g ionic cordova
```
Then run:

```bash
$ npm install
```
```bash
$ ionic serve
```
More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](https://ionicframework.com/getting-started) page and the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) repo.
