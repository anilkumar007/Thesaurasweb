A starting project for Ionic that optionally supports using custom SCSS.

## Using this project

We recommend using the [Ionic CLI](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-cli) to create new Ionic projects.<br/>
a.Make sure whether Nodejs is installed or not <br/>
To check it first navigate to command line and type node -v <br/>
if the output shows node is not recognised as internal or external command than we can conclude node is not installed locally<br/>
To install nodejs use these [link](https://nodejs.org/en/) and download only the recommanded for most users

b.Make sure whether Ionic is installed or not <br/>

To check it first navigate to command line <br/>

and start typing the command as ionic -v <br/>

if the output shows ionic is not recognised as internal or external command than we can conclude ionic is not installed locally<br/>

To install ionic locally use the below commands

if you are using a MAC OS or Ubuntu please use these command to install the ionic CLI if it is not installed locally

```bash
